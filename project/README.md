## My Final Project for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science
The technology that I have used in this project is Django Framework.
It's a website which allows you to keep track of your projects: whether it's a project that:
                1. You have just started
                2.  You would like to do in the future
                3. You have finished.
                
## Things that you can do in this website:

1. New: This function allows to create a new project;
2. Delete a project;
3. Update: You can update a project that you have already created

You can view the list of your projects in Home page.
